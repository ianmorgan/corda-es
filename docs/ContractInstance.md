# Contract Instance 

Without states, how do we make sure events are linked to the correct chain when written to the ledger,
that is how do we ensure that events for IOU A aren't kept separate from IOU B? This is managed by 
the concept of Contract Instance  

The principle is very simple, the first event (the issuing event) is special.
